# BrainWire – End-to-End Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents a complete Business Intelligence solution for **BrainWire**, an imaginary tech-product e-commerce company.

The dataset was synthetically generated using **Python** with utmost realism, simulating transactional, customer, marketing campaign and web behavioral data typical of a modern online electronics retailer.

The solution is built in **Power BI** using a structured star-schema data model, calculated DAX measures, KPI tracking and multi-page executive dashboards.
